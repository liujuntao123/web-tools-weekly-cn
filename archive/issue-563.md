As many of you know, I've been writing this newsletter since 2013! Amazing how long it's been and how much the web development industry has changed over that time period.  
  
One thing that's been happening lately, as you've probably noticed, is that there is a huge amount of saturation in the newsletter industry. That's making it harder and harder to make a newsletter profitable. It's harder to find sponsors, which often leads to creators like myself using affiliate links, pay-per-click advertising, or even ad swaps with other newsletters.  
  
These solutions aren't terrible, but they don't bring in enough money to warrant the time I put into the newsletter each week. So for the first time in more than 10 years, I'm going to start offering my readers the option to support the newsletter directly via donations. I'll never make the newsletter pay-only. But I think it's nice if readers have the option to pay, if they have it in their budget, to help keep the newsletter afloat. So here's my pitch:  
  
[**Support Web Tools Weekly via GitHub Sponsors**](https://github.com/sponsors/impressivewebs)

This newsletter has about 13,400 subscribers. If I can get [**$1 USD per month**](https://github.com/sponsors/impressivewebs) from 2,000 of those subscribers, I would never have to include an advertisement or affiliate link again.

This is a one-person newsletter, I don't have anyone here to help me find sponsors, do marketing, etc. It's literally just me. So I'd love it if you could help fund the newsletter and I can focus on the content without the need to seek out ways to monetize, which nowadays takes many hours every week.  
  
Of course, some of you won't be able to support the newsletter, and that's perfectly fine. Regardless of what happens with funding, none of the content in this newsletter is going to change and it will always be free as long as I continue to do it.  
  
With funding, those who have it in their budget can support the newsletter on behalf of those who can't afford it or who choose not to. It's basically a pay-what-you-want model.  
  
[**Support Web Tools Weekly with a One-time Contribution**](https://paypal.me/webtoolsweekly)

Of course, you don't have to commit to a monthly sponsor schedule via GitHub to offer a contribution. GitHub Sponsors offers a one-time contribution option and you can also do so [**using PayPal**](https://paypal.me/webtoolsweekly).

From this point on, I will be more aggressively pursuing these types of contributions with, as mentioned, the ultimate goal of removing ads completely from the newsletter.  
  
Thanks to everyone for your continued readership over the years. For those of you who are newly subscribed: I hope this intro doesn't come across as some form of begging. I rarely do this sort of thing, but I'll probably be including more solicitations like this in the ad spots, to help with funding and hopefully removing all ads in the future.  
  
Now on to this week's tools!
