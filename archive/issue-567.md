Lately I've been thinking that we may currently be in the dying days of the tech book. For a long time now, it's been fairly difficult for tech writers to make a decent living off authoring tech or programming books. We all know it's fairly easy to just 'google it' when you want to learn something. But tech books were still popular because it was nice to be able to read a professionally edited tutorial on a difficult topic.  
  
Now, however, it's not just search engines that are competing with authors, but AI-based tools like ChatGPT, Gemini, and similar. These tools have been trained on sources that we've relied on for years. So why bother purchasing a book when the information is at your finger tips and you don't even have to worry about SEO spam anymore?

Are tech and programming books in their dying days?

Of course, tools like ChatGPT are far from perfect. I've received answers from ChatGPT that I know are wrong. It seems like that's going to continue to happen at least to some extent. But it also seems that more and more tech professionals are relying on AI tools to do research for them that they would previously get from a search engine, an online reference, or a book. And since the book is the only one we used to pay for, it's easy for the book to become the one that stops being used.  
  
I've authored or co-authored multiple books over the past 12 years and the revenue from those was fairly minimal even when books were selling well. So I can imagine how tough it must be now to try to make decent side money from a book.  
  
If you happen to still be interested in buying tech books, I maintain a couple of reading lists (all affiliate links):

*   This newsletter's [reading list](https://webtoolsweekly.com/reading/) for books on programming (mainly front-end development)
*   A reading list [for my Tech Productivity newsletter](https://techproductivity.co/reading/) with various books on productivity and related topics

We'll have to see how things play out, but it certainly feels like the days of being able to bring in some extra money from authoring tech books is soon going to be a thing of the past for many of us.  
  
Now on to this week's tools!
