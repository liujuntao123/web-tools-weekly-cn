I'm taking a break from the intro tip for the next little while but the rest of the newsletter will remain the same.  
  
Meantime, please consider [**supporting my work**](https://github.com/sponsors/impressivewebs) (see the ad spot above). It really helps if I can get direct contributions rather than spending time trying to track down appropriate ads and other ways to monetize.
