A short while ago I reported that CSS-Tricks was kinda-sorta back with some recent updates. There doesn't seem to be a lot of new stuff there, but some of the "new" posts are updates to older posts. Besides that, new posts still seem to be rare.  
  
But in case you didn't know, Chris Coyier, the original CSS-Tricks founder, is still fairly active in writing about front-end technologies:

*   [**Chris's personal blog**](https://chriscoyier.net/) where he writes about and links to all sorts of things including some front-end stuff.
*   [**Chris's author page on the Frontend Masters blog**](https://frontendmasters.com/blog/author/chriscoyier/) where he's been contributing since about November, with lots of stuff in the same vein as he posted regularly on CSS-Tricks before it was sold to Digital Ocean.
*   [**The CodePen blog**](https://blog.codepen.io/) where there's more of a focus on the CodePen platform, but still lots to help those interested in learning about the latest in front-end technologies.

So if you haven't yet added those to your RSS feed, be sure to do so. And while I'm on the topic of RSS feeds, I continue to sporadically update my [Frontend Feeds](https://github.com/impressivewebs/frontend-feeds) GitHub repository, though it does probably need a larger overhaul at the moment. Feel free to submit a PR if you want anything added.
